### Cassandra In Agony

> Christy told us that he and his wife had arguments and fights regarding his job, but knowing them I can assure you that Christy Annunziata and Cassandra R Annunziata are a wonderful couple.

> But its very true that Cassandra had very strong opinions about his job and had a strong disgust for the people Christy had to deal with. She is very vocal about it on social media, you have to check out her latest post on twitter, it's hilarious how easy it is to FLAG her alarms.

Since the question says twitter, that's where we go! On searching on twitter we find the twitter account of Cassandra R. Annunziata, with a post mentioning some document.

On looking at her website link , it leads to the CIA website which contained all the information gained from extraction of Osama's hard drive. Since in the post it mentioned document, we select docements at the bottom of the page and search for `suicide_bombing_attack` since it seemed like a suspicious looking string.

Since in the twitter post, Cassie said `his name really FLAGS my nerves`, if pretty obvious that the dude's name is the flag. Going through the PDF you'll find his name and there you have it.

Tiny easter egg: The first letters of this challenge translate to CIA :)

#### Flag: Muaath al-Turki
